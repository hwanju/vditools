This document describes how to use the tools for analyzing VDI results.

1. Load monitoring
# systemtap/vdi_load.stp > load.dump
# ./load_profile.py load.dump

1) The above generates 'load-vm<vm_id>-vcpu<vcpu_id>-id<profile_id>.dat'.
2) Each file includes epoch id, physical time for each epoch, time taken by vcpu, time taken by guest threads.
3) Each file also includes information about a UI event corresponding to this load profile at the first line.
