- systemtap
- gnuplot

1. Load monitoring
# systemtap/vdi_load.stp > load.dump
# ./load_profile.py load.dump
# ./mkplt_load_profile.sh <vm_id> <profile_id>

1) The above generates 'load-vm<vm_id>-vcpu<vcpu_id>-id<profile_id>.dat'.
2) Each file includes epoch id, physical time for each epoch, time taken by vcpu, time taken by guest threads.
3) Each file also includes information about a UI event corresponding to this load profile at the first line.
4) mkplt_load_profile.sh generates 'load-vm<vm_id>-id<profile_id>.eps, which is a graph-style profile
